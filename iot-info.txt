1. PIR (Passive Infrared)
2. IR 
3. Serial port communication
/* UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter */
- data is transferred serially bit by bit
- at a pre-defined baud rate (bits per second)
- Three interfaces: UART0 (reserved), UART1, UART2
/* SPI / I2C - synchronous */
Serial.begin(baud_rate);
Serial.println(message);
Serial.available();
Serial.read();

4. Light Dependent Resistor (has sensitivity adjuster)
- has both analog & digital inputs.

# in lab 4, serial communication and light dependent resistor
Lab 3

5. DHT11

#include <DHT.h>
#define DHT11_PIN 21

DHT dht11 (DHT11_PIN, DHT11); 

dht11.begin();

dht11.readHumidity();
dht11.readTemperature(); // Celsius
dht11.readTemperature(true); // Fahrenheit
isnan();
To convert *C to *F:
F = C * 9 / 5 + 32;

6. LM35 sensor:
- it is also a temperature sensor
#define ADC_VREF_mV 3300.0
#define ADC_RESOLUTION 4096.0
#define PIN_LM35 36 // you can just put 13 - ADC0

analogSetAttenudation(ADC_11db);

int adcVal = analogRead(PIN_LM35);
float milliVolt = adcVal * (ADC_VREF_mV / ADC_RESOLUTION);
float tempC = milliVolt / 10;
float tempF = tempC * 9 / 5 + 32; 

7. Controlling LED using Potentiometer
map() function, commonly used in arduino
map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
sensorValue: This is the input value that you want to re-map. In the context of Arduino, this often represents a raw analog reading from a sensor, which typically ranges from 0 to 1023 (for a 10-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter).
0: This is the lower bound of the input range (sensorValue).
1023: This is the upper bound of the input range (sensorValue).
0: This is the lower bound of the desired output range.
255: This is the upper bound of the desired output range.

8. PIR & IR

Detection Method:
IR sensors: (often active IR) emit infrared light and detect the reflected light from objects. 
PIR sensors: (passive IR) detect changes in infrared radiation (heat) emitted by objects, without emitting their own infrared light. 
Object Detection:
IR sensors can detect the presence of an object based on reflected light, regardless of whether it's moving. 
PIR sensors are primarily used to detect motion, as they are sensitive to changes in heat signatures caused by movement.
